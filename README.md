# Getting Started with the Graph Query Language (GQL)

## Overview

Discover over 50 practical examples and a real-world case study to help you build and query graph databases in this first comprehensive, hands-on guide to the Graph Query Language.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Tutorials**: Learn and apply key concepts and syntax through practical examples via the GQL Playground.
- **Advanced Features**: Leverage advanced capabilities of GQL to manipulate graph data efficiently.
- **Real-World Applications**: Explore practical GQL use cases in data analytics and beyond.
- **Bonus Content**: Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free PDF eBook.

### Book Description

Graph Query Language (ISO GQL) is a standard language for databases, designed to manage and support graph data analytics. Authored by a team of industry veterans, this book simplifies GQL concepts, including graph terms, definitions, the catalog's hierarchical system, and its objects.

Through practical examples, you'll master graph data types, value expressions, graph matching patterns, data and catalog modifying statements, functions, and various clauses. With access to the GQL Playground via Ultipa Graph, you'll gain hands-on experience in querying and manipulating graph data.

The book delves into advanced topics such as path modes, complex path matching patterns, shortest path queries, composite statements, session and transaction commands, and procedures. You'll also learn to create extensions and design graph databases to address industry challenges. Techniques like property graphs will help you optimize and accelerate your graph queries.

By the end of this book, you'll be proficient in using GQL to query and update data, run graph algorithms, generate results, and visualize them. You'll also gain insights into the future of GQL and graph technology, applying your knowledge to a real-world use case of money flow analysis for assessing bank client behaviors and detecting transaction risks.

### What You Will Learn

- Experiment with GQL syntax on the GQL Playground, including `MATCH`, `RETURN`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- Work with operators, functions, and variables in an organized manner.
- Master complex topics such as varying path matching modes, repeated variables, shortest path queries, procedures, and transactions.
- Enhance execution speed using indexing or caching systems.
- Effectively manage access control.
- Solve real-world problems with a case study focused on money transaction analytics.

### Who This Book Is For

This book is ideal for graph database developers, DBAs, programmers, data engineers, and analysts eager to learn the new graph database standard, GQL. A basic understanding of graph and relational databases, data models, and programming will make the content easier to grasp. While the book is accessible to those without a background in graph theory, familiarity with concepts like nodes, edges, relationships, and the distinction between directed and undirected graphs will enhance your learning experience.
