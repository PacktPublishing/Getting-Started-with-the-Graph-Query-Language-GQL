Graph Query Language is becoming the go-to standard for graph databases, especially with its support for interconnected analytics and GenAI capabilities. This book comes from a team of industry veterans who know exactly how to break down the fundamental GQL concepts, graph terms, definitions, catalog systems, and everything that matters in actual work.
You’ll get to grips with graph data types, value expressions, graph matching patterns, and modifying statements through practical GQL examples. With access to the GQL Playground via Ultipa Graph, you’ll get hands-on experience querying and manipulating graph data. 
Once you've got the basics down, you’ll tackle advanced GQL topics such as path modes, complex path matching patterns, shortest path queries, composite statements, session and transaction commands, and procedures. You’ll also learn to create extensions and understand the design of graph databases to solve industry issues. The authors cover techniques like property graphs to help you optimize your graph queries and offer insights into the future of GQL and graph technology.
By the end of this book, you’ll confidently query and update graph data, run graph algorithms, and create visualizations. Plus, you’ll apply your learnings to a real-world use case of money flow analysis for assessing bank client behaviors and detecting transaction risks.</details>

  <summary><h2>Who This Book Is For</summary>

This book is ideal for graph database developers, DBAs, programmers, data engineers, and analysts eager to learn the new graph database standard, GQL. A basic understanding of graph and relational databases, data models, and programming will make the content easier to grasp. While the book is accessible to those without a background in graph theory, familiarity with concepts like nodes, edges, relationships, and the distinction between directed and undirected graphs will enhance your learning experience.
